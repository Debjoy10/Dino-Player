### How to Run-
Make sure internet connection in **off** and proxy set to **Automatic**. Run **python3 advanced_dinogoogle.py** (or dinogoogle.py for initial approach). Web page on chrome is automatically opened.



Highest score ~750 and Average Score ~500

#### Update 1: 
advanced_dinogoogle.py tracks cactuses in frame and estimates their speed using edge and contour detection. Better tuned thresholds required
