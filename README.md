## DINO-PLAYER

DinoPlayer is the first step towards automating google's no internet dinosaur game using a brute-force approach.

#### Update 1: 
advanced_dinogoogle.py tracks cactuses in frame and estimates their speed using edge and contour detection. Better tuned thresholds required 


Make sure internet connection in **off** and proxy set to **Automatic**. Web page on chrome is automatically opened.

Run **python3 advanced_dinogoogle.py** (or dinogoogle.py for initial approach)
